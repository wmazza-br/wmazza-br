<h1 align="left">Engineer William Mazza's Data Science Project Portfolio</h1>
<p align="left">Professional passionate about data, who decided to learn data science on his own. </p>
<p align="left">I started with a postgraduate course on the subject, and then I went deeper into Python and its libraries. </p>
<p align="left">I've also studied a lot of statistics and machine learning models.</p> 
<p align="left">Here on GitHub are my projects from the beginning.</p> 
<p align="left">Someone may ask 'what is the importance of showing projects from the most basic?' I answer.</p> 
<p align="left">It is to verify the evolution of knowledge.</p> 
<p align="left">One day, I'll still look back and see where I started, and I'll be very proud of that.</p>
