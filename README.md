<p align="center">Professional passionate about data, who decided to learn data science on his own. </p>

<p align="center">I've also studied a lot of statistics and machine learning models.</p> 
<p align="center">Here on GitHub are my projects from the first.</p> 
<p align="center">Someone may ask what is the importance of showing projects from the most basic. I answer.</p> 
<p align="center">It is to verify the evolution of knowledge.</p>
